🧩 Why DevOps?

The main goal of DevOps is to deliver high-quality software faster to the end users by improving collaboration between Development and Operations teams.

Traditional software delivery faced problems like:

Slow deployment cycles

Miscommunication between teams

Manual testing and configuration

Frequent production issues

DevOps solves these challenges by automating and integrating every step of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) — from planning to monitoring — enabling continuous delivery and faster innovation.

⚙️ SDLC Overview

In a traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), there are two main teams:

1️⃣ Development Team

Responsible for building the software.

They handle:

Planning – defining features, requirements, and timelines.

Coding – writing the actual source code.

Building – compiling and packaging the code into deployable artifacts.

Testing – verifying that code works as expected.

2️⃣ Operations Team

Responsible for deploying and maintaining the application.

They handle:

Deployment – releasing the build to production environments.

Monitoring – ensuring the system runs smoothly and efficiently.

Maintenance – handling incidents, scaling, and updates.

⚔️ The Problem (Before DevOps)
Challenge	Description
Silos	Dev and Ops worked separately with little communication.
Slow Releases	Manual testing and deployment took days or weeks.
Frequent Failures	Environments were inconsistent (it works on my machine!).
No Automation	Manual configuration, testing, and monitoring.
