🧩 Why DevOps?

The main goal of DevOps is to deliver high-quality software faster to the end users by improving collaboration between Development and Operations teams.

Traditional software delivery faced problems like:

Slow deployment cycles

Miscommunication between teams

Manual testing and configuration

Frequent production issues

DevOps solves these challenges by automating and integrating every step of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) — from planning to monitoring — enabling continuous delivery and faster innovation.

⚙️ SDLC Overview

In a traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), there are two main teams:

1️⃣ Development Team

Responsible for building the software.

They handle:

Planning – defining features, requirements, and timelines.

Coding – writing the actual source code.

Building – compiling and packaging the code into deployable artifacts.

Testing – verifying that code works as expected.

2️⃣ Operations Team

Responsible for deploying and maintaining the application.

They handle:

Deployment – releasing the build to production environments.

Monitoring – ensuring the system runs smoothly and efficiently.

Maintenance – handling incidents, scaling, and updates.

⚔️ The Problem (Before DevOps)
Challenge	Description
Silos	     ->Dev and Ops worked separately with little communication.
Slow Releases ->	Manual testing and deployment took days or weeks.
Frequent Failures	->Environments were inconsistent (it works on my machine!).
No Automation   ->	Manual configuration, testing, and monitoring.


========================================
🚀 The DevOps Approach

DevOps bridges the gap by combining Development + Operations through:

Automation of builds, testing, and deployment.

Continuous Integration (CI) – merging and testing code frequently.

Continuous Delivery (CD) – automatically delivering tested code to production.

Collaboration Tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

🧠 Key Benefits of DevOps

✅ Faster delivery of applications
✅ Higher deployment frequency
✅ Improved collaboration between teams
✅ Fewer failures and quick recovery
✅ Increased efficiency through automation
